# DrugSideEffects

This project aims at predicting side effects of drugs based on their chemical and structural features, their interactions with the (metabolic) network of genes, and their (structure) similarity relationships. Side effects, drugs, and genes are represented as node of a heterogeneous graph. Gene-gene interactions, drug-gene interactions, and drug-drug similarity relationships are represented as distinct sets of edges in the graph. The associations between drugs and side-effects are determined through a link prediction between the set of drug nodes and the set of side-effect nodes.
